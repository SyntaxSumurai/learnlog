# Java OOPs Basics

## Classes and Objects

#### Class
- A class is simply a blueprint or template for creating objects. A class encapsulates (hides the data and functions) data and functions that operate on the data or manipulate it.

#### Object
- An object is an instance (copy) of a class. When a class is defined, only the description for the object is defined; no memory or storage is allocated.
- When an object is created, the memory is allocated and the objects now contain the actual data stored in the attributes or variables and also can manipulate that data using the methods defined in the class.

## Access Specifiers

Access specifiers determine the visibility & accessibility of methods, variables & classes.

#### Most common are:

- **public** 
   - When a class/method/variable is declared as public, it can be accessed from `anywhere` in the program.
- **private**
  - When a class/method/variable is declared as private, it can only be accessed within the class. And to use it outside the class, we need to `inherit` the class.
- **protected**
  - When a class/method/variable is declared as protected, it can be accessed within the `package` and in `subclasses`.
  
:::note Default Access Specifier
If no access specifier is declared, then Java by default sets a `package-private` access modifier, which means the class or method is only accessible within its own package.
:::

## Main Method & Its Role

```java title="Simple Hello World Program"
class Basics {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

- `class` is a keyword used to declare a class in Java.
- `Basics` is the name of the class. The name of the Java file should be the same as the class name.
- `public` is an access specifier. It means that the class is accessible by any other class.
- `static` is a keyword which allows us/JVM to call the methods directly without creating an instance/object of the class.
- `void` is a keyword which means that the method does not return any value.
- `main` is the name of the method.
- `String[] args` is the parameter of the method. It is an array of strings named as `args`, and it is used to store command line arguments.

:::note
To access the static methods use this syntax:
```java
className.methodName();
```
:::

## Creating & Using Objects

Objects are instances of a class. To access a non-static method, an object of that class needs to be created using the `new` keyword.

```java
className objectName = new className(); 
```

Once the object is created, it now contains actual data in the form of attributes and can also manipulate the data using the methods defined in the class.

```java title="Creating & Using Objects"
class Test {
    int age;
    
    public void assignAge(int num) {
        age = num;
    }
}

class Basics {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test test1 = new Test(); // object1 created
        test1.assignAge(20);
        
        Test test2 = new Test(); // object2 created
        test2.assignAge(25);

        System.out.println(test1.age); // Output: 20
        System.out.println(test2.age); // Output: 25
    }
}
```

In the above example, we created two objects of the class `Test` and called the `assignAge` method. One object is `test1` with value `20` and the other is `test2` with value `25`.

So when we printed the value of `test1.age` it printed `20` and when we printed the value of `test2.age` it printed `25`. This is because each object has its own copy of the attributes. This means that the value of the attribute `age` is different for each object.

Hence, we can say that the objects are independent of each other.

## Constructors

Constructors are special methods that are used to initialize objects. They are automatically called when an object is created.

The main role of a constructor is to set initial values for object attributes & perform any necessary setup tasks.

### Key Points:
- Constructors have the same name as the class name.
- Constructors do not have a return type.
- Constructors are called automatically when an object is created.

### Types of Constructors

#### Default Constructor
A default constructor is a constructor that has no parameters. If no constructor is defined, Java automatically provides a default constructor that initializes the object attributes to their default values.

```java title="Default Constructor Example"
class Student {
    String name;
    int age;
    
    // Default constructor
    public Student() {
        name = "Unknown";
        age = 0;
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student student1 = new Student();
        System.out.println("Name: " + student1.name); // Output: Name: Unknown
        System.out.println("Age: " + student1.age);   // Output: Age: 0
    }
}
```

#### Parameterized Constructor
A parameterized constructor is a constructor that has parameters. It is used to initialize the object attributes with specific values.

```java title="Parameterized Constructor Example"
class Student {
    String name;
    int age;
    
    // Parameterized constructor
    public Student(String studentName, int studentAge) {
        name = studentName;
        age = studentAge;
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student student1 = new Student("John", 20);
        System.out.println("Name: " + student1.name); // Output: Name: John
        System.out.println("Age: " + student1.age);   // Output: Age: 20
    }
}
```

:::note Constructor Overloading
Constructor overloading is a feature that allows a class to have multiple constructors with different parameters.

```java title="Constructor Overloading Example"
class Student {
    String name;
    int age;
    String course;
    
    // Default constructor
    public Student() {
        name = "Unknown";
        age = 0;
        course = "Not Assigned";
    }
    
    // Constructor with name and age
    public Student(String studentName, int studentAge) {
        name = studentName;
        age = studentAge;
        course = "Not Assigned";
    }
    
    // Constructor with all parameters
    public Student(String studentName, int studentAge, String studentCourse) {
        name = studentName;
        age = studentAge;
        course = studentCourse;
    }
}
```
:::


## Encapsulation

Is simply means bind the data together in one class and restrict the access to the data from outside the class.

e.g: capsule  which has some part visible and some part not visible. Means it is a whole one thing only but we can only access the visible part(public available thing only).

#### Key Points:
- Data Hiding : Encapsulation hides the internal details of how an object works. The objects data is kept private & can only be accessed through methods (getters & setters).
- Controlled Access : Encapsulation allows us to control how the data is accessed and modified (getters & setters)


```java title="Encapsulation Example"
class BankAccount{
    private double balance;

    public double getBalance(){
        return balance;
    }

    public void setBalance(double balance){
        this.balance = balance;
    }
}
class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
        account.setBalance(1000.0);
        System.out.println("Balance: " + account.getBalance());
    }
}
```

In the above example we have used the getters and setter as we can't have direct access to the private balance variable. And hence via this approach we can control the access to the data.

## Inheritance

It's a concept that allows a class to inherit properties & behaviors(methods & fields) from another class.

#### Key Points:
- Reuse of code : As we can directly access the parent methods and variables in the child class hence no need to write the same code again.
- Extended Functionality : Child classes can have it's own features and can override the parent class methods to get the specific functionality.

```java title="Inheritance Example"
class Vehicle{
    private String vehicleNumber;

    public Vehicle(String vehicleNumber){
        this.vehicleNumber = vehicleNumber;
    }

    public void honk(){
        System.out.println("Honk! Honk!");
    }

    public void printVehicleNumber(){
        System.out.println("Vehicle Number: " + vehicleNumber);
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle{
    public Car(String vehicleNumber){
        super(vehicleNumber);
    }
}

class Bus{
    public Bus(String vehicleNumber){
        super(vehicleNumber);
    }
}

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Car car = new Car("ABC123");
        car.honk(); // Output: Honk! Honk!
        car.printVehicleNumber(); // Output: Vehicle Number: ABC123

        Bus bus = new Bus("DEF456");
        bus.honk(); // Output: Honk! Honk!
        bus.printVehicleNumber(); // Output: Vehicle Number: DEF456
    }
}
```

:::note
syntax to inherit a class:
class **child_class_name** `extends` **parent_class_name**
- `extends` keyword is used to inherit the parent class.
:::

## Polymorphism
It's a concept that allows an object to take on many forms.

#### Key Points:
- Method Overloading(Compile-time Polymorphism) : Method overloading is a feature that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
- Method Overriding(Runtime Polymorphism) : Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

```java title="Polymorphism Example"
class Vehicle{
    private String vehicleNumber;

    public vehicle(String vehicleNumber){
        this.vehicleNumber = vehicleNumber;
    }

    public void honk(){
        System.out.println("Honk!!!!");
    }

    public void printVehicleNumber(){
        System.out.println("Vehicle Number: " + vehicleNumber);
    }
}

class car extends Vehicle{
    public car(String carNumber){
        super(carNumber);
    }

    @override
    public void honk(){
        System.out.println("Car Honk!!");
    }
}

class Bus extends Vehicle{
    public Bus(String busNumber){
        super(busNumber);
    }
}

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Car car = new Car("AB12CD245B");
        car.honk();

        Bus bus = new Bus("CD12VF45F8");
        bus.honk();

        System.out.println("Car Number: ",car.printVehicleNumber());
        System.out.println("Bus Number: ",bus.printVehicleNumber());
    }
}
```

#### Try it here

<OneCompiler url="https://onecompiler.com/java/43ph5x23s" />

In the above code we have two different methods inheriting the same class but in the car class we implemented exact same method that was in vehicle hence for the car class that method will be called and this technique is called as `Method Overriding` and hence in the honk time it will print `Car Honk!!` whereas the bus will still print the `Honk!!!!`.


## Abstraction
Abstraction is a concept that focuses on hiding complex implementations and only exposing the necessary features of an object or method.

#### Key Points:
- Hides Complexity: Abstraction allows a user to interact with an object or method without needing to know the underlying implementation
- Simplifies Interaction: Only the important aspects are made public hence simple interaction.

> A good example is a Car, As in car we just directly interact with the simplified things like steering, brakes, gear and like that without knowing the actual internal thing that how it works.

### Ways to achieve Abstraction
1. Abstract class
2. Interfaces

### Abstract class
An abstract class is a class that can be directly `instantiated` directly (can't create object directly). It can have both regular as well as abstract methods.

:::note
Abstract methods are methods with no body just definition. And `abstract` keyword is used to declare an abstract class.
```java
abstract class Animal{
    public void sound();
}
```
:::
Abstract methods are intended to be implemented by subclass.Ensuring each subclass will have its own implementation of the method.

#### Key Points:
- Can't be instantiated
- Abstract method
- Can have regular methods

```java title="Abstraction Example"
abstract class Animal{
    abstract void sound();
    void sleep(){
        System.out.println("This animal is sleeping!!");
    }
}

class dog extends Animal{
    void sound(){
        System.out.println("Bark!!");
    }
}
```


### Interfaces
Interface is a completely abstract type and only contains the abstract methods.

:::info
From Java8  interfaces can contain static and default methods with body & from java9 private method as well
:::

#### Key Points
- Pure Abstraction
- No Instantiation
- Multiple Implementation

```java title="Interface Example"
interface Animal{
    void sound();
}

class dog implements Animal{
    void sound(){
        System.out.println("Barks!!");
    }
}
```

#### Pros of Interfaces
- Multiple Inheritance: A class can implement multiple interface unlike classes that can only extend one class.
- Loose Coupling: Interface helps to reduce the dependencies between differnt parts of the code making the system more modular & easier to maintain.
